## ðŸ“š About:
So there is a little joke embodied in case you didn't realize: technically there aren't any sand grains, but the backgroud color is the color of the sand soooo...are we sure you can't see any? ðŸ˜‰

<li>The index.html file only contains the Open Paragraphs tags and an h1 title as I wanted to create everything dynamically;</li>
<li>The style.css file is simple and well organized: it contains mainly some paddings and margins. The media query tags make it fully responsive;</li>
<li>The script.js file contains the main code. The page has a body and several containers to organize the elements. The functions created to avoid repetitions uses an "click" eventListener and an updateDisplay tag.</li>
</ol>
