in index.html you can find a generic <div> working as a container of the counter itself. 
Inside the div I have inserted three buttons and a title that shows the number increasing, decreasing or starting over. 
I have styled all this element with some simple css (paddings, margins and some background colors). In addition to this, it is responsive as I have added some media query. 
The Javascript code is minimal but functional. 
I have named four variables, one for each button and one for the title that contains the number changing. 
To make it interactive, I have used the querySelector, addEventListener (onclick) and textContent commands. Plus, to the title variable I have added a simple function with ++ or --

What about you see for yourself how beautiful it is?
